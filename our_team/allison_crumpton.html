            <p>
              Allison Crumpton joined Haryett & Company in 2015 while studying
              law at the University of Alberta. She articled with Kent Haryett
              in 2016-2017 before being called to the Bar in 2017. Allison
              practices in criminal law as well as wills and estates. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Born and
              raised in Edmonton, Allison completed a Bachelor of Science with
              Specialization in Psychology at the University of Alberta and
              graduated in 2010. Following graduation, she continued at the
              University of Alberta to study Business, majoring in Accounting.
              She transferred programs in 2013 following her acceptance into the
              University of Alberta law school. Allison graduated with her law
              degree in 2016. While focusing on advocacy and criminal law, she
              also took a variety of courses relating to civil matters, family
              law and wills and estates. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Allison volunteered extensively with
              Student Legal Services in both the criminal law project and the
              civil law project during her 3 years at law school. She worked
              full time for the SLS criminal law project during the summers of
              2014 and 2015, representing numerous low-income individuals who
              were facing criminal charges. In her second and third years of law
              school, Allison served as a day leader with SLS and supervised
              8-10 volunteers per year. She gained invaluable practical
              experience working for SLS and articling for Kent Haryett. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Allison
              understands the important role she plays in assisting individuals
              who are facing criminal charges and is grateful to be in a
              position to advocate for her clients and guide them through the
              criminal law process. Following graduation she cultivated her
              interest in wills and estates. She enjoys meeting people in
              circumstances where she can provide some peace of mind that their
              estate and personal affairs will be taken care of for their loved
              ones. Allison is pleased to represent clients across Alberta.
              Schedule a consultation with Allison today to get dedicated legal
              representation.
