            <p>
              Kyle Procee joined Haryett &amp; Company in 2018 as an articling
              student under Kent Haryett for the 2018&hyphen; 2019 year after having
              studied law at the University of Alberta Law School before being
              called to the bar in July 0f 2019&period; Kyle&apos; s practice is primarily
              focused in criminal law&period;
            </p>
            <p>
              Kyle was born and raised in Lethbridge&comma;
              Alberta where he attended the University of Lethbridge and
              completed a Bachelor of Arts majoring in English and minoring in
              Political Science in 2014&period; Following graduation&comma; he made the move
              to Edmonton after having been accepted into the University of
              Alberta faculty of law&period; Edmonton quickly became his home and the
              city that he plans to start his career within&period; Kyle graduated with
              his Juris Doctor degree from the University of Alberta Law School
              in 2018&period; A large portion of his focus throughout his legal
              education was in advocacy and criminal law in particular&comma; though
              he did leave with a well&hyphen;rounded legal education that included
              courses in family&comma; civil and international law&period; Kyle volunteered
              extensively with Criminal Law Project of Student Legal Services
              throughout the entirety of his law school career&period; He worked
              fulltime as a Criminal Law Summer Caseworker during the summer of
              his second year in law school and then subsequently volunteered as
              a Criminal Law Day Leader for the project throughout the entirety
              of his final year of law school&period; During this time&comma; Kyle was able
              to act for a significant number of members of Edmonton and area&apos;s
              low&hyphen;income community who were facing various criminal charges
              ranging between assaults&comma; theft under &dollar;5000&comma; impaired driving and
              many other criminal charges&period; Additionally&comma; Kyle supervised and
              managed SLS volunteers assigned to his shift where he was able to
              provide the insights of his experiences with SLS in order to
              assist them with their own files&period; Kyle&apos;s work with Student Legal
              Services was the spark that confirmed his passion for criminal law
              and his desire to assist those who are facing overwhelming charges
              and need someone to advocate for them&period;
            </p>
            <p>
              Kyle understands the
              important role that a criminal defence lawyer plays within the
              criminal justice system and is eager to be an advocate working
              tirelessly for his clients and helping to guide them throughout a
              particularly complex and difficult process&period; He enjoys being able
              to stand up for people who need and deserve assistance against an
              intimidating court system&period; Kyle is pleased to represent clients
              throughout Alberta&period; Schedule a consultationwith Kyle today to get
