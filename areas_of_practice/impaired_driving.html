        Dui&comma; Dwi&comma; Impaired&comma; And Drunk Driving Defense Lawyers
      </h2>
      <p>
        Everybody makes errors once in a while&comma; including people who may have had 
        a little too much to drink and the police officers who make DWI arrests and 
        impaired driving arrests&period; There is so much to lose when you or someone you 
        know is arrested and charged with driving impaired&period; Being represented by a 
        DUI lawyer who knows the system and can give you the best chance of your 
        drunk driving arrest and impaired driving charges getting dismissed or 
        reduced is absolutely crucial&period; The Edmonton impaired driving defence team 
        at the Law Offices of R&period; Kent Haryett & Company have established a reputation 
        as one of the premier law offices that can help their clients continue their 
        normal&comma; everyday life after DUI arrests&period;
      </p>
      <p>
        Impaired driving charges occur when a police officer suspects that a substance, 
        chemical or condition is impairing a driver&apos;s ability to operate a motor vehicle 
        safely&period; The majority of impaired driving arrests involve drinking and driving&period; 
        It is becoming more and more common for these arrests to occur because an arresting 
        officer suspects that the accused driver is under the influence of illegal drugs or 
        even legal prescription medications&period; When looking for one of the top impaired driving 
        lawyers&comma; Edmonton has Haryett & Co&period; who is well recognized for successfully and

        Losing Your License Would Be Devastating
      </h2>
      <p>
        Should you be charged with Impaired Driving, an Over 80 offence&comma; or Failure or refusal 
        to comply with demand&comma; it could have a major impact on your life&comma; career and relationships&period; 
        It is essential that you choose a DUI lawyer that has demonstrated a history of success in 
        with the Alberta justice system&period; A person can have their driving license revoked or suspended 
        if they convicted of an Impaired Driving offence&period; The range of reprimands and consequences 
        from an DUI or drunk driving related accident can include&colon;
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A life&hyphen;long criminal record</li>
        <li>Loss of work and Career opportunities</li>
        <li>Forfeiture of License</li>
        <li>Reduced ability to care for children</li>
        <li>Enforced Treatment Programs&comma; DUI Classes</li>

        <li>Impaired Driving Laws &amp; DUI Charges Are Not Set In Stone</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Drunk driving law states that it is illegal to operate a motor vehicle&comma; while having the care or control 
        over that vehicle&comma; while one’s ability to operate that vehicle is impaired by alcohol&period; DWI laws also 
        state that&comma; if you are taken into custody on suspicion that you are driving drunk&comma; that a qualified 
        technician will take samples of the accused driver’s breath into a breathalyzer device known as the 
        Intoxylizer 5000C&period; The test is given to determine how many milligrams of alcohol exists per 100 milliliters 
        of blood. DUI laws state that the charge of “over &period;08”, or “over 80”&comma; is normally added if the driver’s 
        breathalyzer sample registers over the legal limit of &period;08&period;  The charge of refusal results when the operator 
        of the motor vehicle refuses to either provide a sample of their breath into the intoxylizer device at the 
        police station or into a certified breath screening apparatus at the roadside&period;
      </p>
      <p>
        As the potential for error is very high during DUI investigations and testing&comma; our objective is get as much of 
        the submitted evidence from the prosecution rejected&period; Impaired Driving&comma; Over 80 and Refusal to comply offences 
        are highly involved&comma; requiring officers and investigators to adhere to strict procedures&period; Even when an 
        investigation is conducted correctly&comma; issue may still be found with roading screening equipment and breath 
        machines&period; In certain situations the equipment may display measurements that may be inaccurate&period; Our DUI defence 
        team at Haryett &amp; Co&period; are very qualified in examining the evidence and scrutinizing errors so that as much 
        evidence as possible is excluded from the police investigation and the prosecution&apos;s case against you&period;
