      <p>
        The sentence for being found guilty of committing a violent sex crime can have long-term, 
        negative effects on the rest of your life, your work & career, your financial situation and 
        your family long after your sentence has been served. You may have to submit your name to 
        federal child-protection registries, you may not be eligible to practise your profession or 
        be admitted into certain graduate school programs. You may also end up on the losing side in 
        family court issues and in child custody decisions. A conviction may further devastate your 
        family life by inhibiting you to volunteer, or coach, or be involved in any of your childrenâ€™s 
        recreational, sports or social activities. If you have been arrested on assault and battery, 
        violent crime or sexual assault charges, do not put everything you have worked for at risk, 
        contact the aggressive and respected defence team at Haryett & Co.
